## 🧑‍💻 Introduction and Self-Assessment

Hello, and thank you for visiting my ePortfolio!

Throughout my four-year academic journey—beginning with an associate’s degree in Computer Information Technology at Indiana Wesleyan University and concluding with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University—I have worked on a wide range of projects, assignments, and research activities that have shaped my technical strengths and professional goals. These experiences have given me the confidence, foundational knowledge, and practical skills necessary to solve real-world problems in the IT and software development fields.

My academic work exposed me to key areas of computing, including programming, data structures and algorithms, artificial intelligence, web application development, and database systems. Completing this ePortfolio, along with several self-directed enhancement projects, allowed me to further refine these skills and demonstrate my adaptability and willingness to master new technologies. Each project became an opportunity to strengthen my problem-solving abilities and expand my understanding of modern software practices.

Collaborative coursework helped me build strong teamwork and communication skills, particularly when using Git and GitHub for version control, code review, and project coordination. I gained experience writing design documents, explaining technical decisions, and presenting complex ideas—such as reinforcement learning behavior or database schema logic—to both technical and non-technical audiences. These experiences strengthened my ability to communicate clearly and work effectively within team environments.

My technical coursework provided a solid foundation in algorithms, software engineering principles, system design, database architecture, and secure coding practices. Building programs that used trees, hash maps, sorting algorithms, and modular design taught me how to evaluate efficiency, scalability, and maintainability. Projects such as my inventory management application and other MongoDB UI dashboards enhanced my understanding of full-stack development, database integration, and structured development workflows. Incorporating secure coding practices—like input validation, safe file handling, and authentication—also reinforced the importance of designing systems that are both functional and secure.

Overall, the combination of academic work and ePortfolio development has prepared me to enter the computer science field with a strong professional identity. I have developed not only technical expertise, but also the values that guide my work: clarity, collaboration, secure and thoughtful design, and a commitment to continuous learning. These experiences have made me confident in my abilities and eager to contribute meaningfully to future IT and software development opportunities.
