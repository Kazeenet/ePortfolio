# Morgan Tyler Kazee - Computer Science ePortfolio
Computer Science Portfolio: Introduction and Self-Assessment

Hello there, and nice to meet you!

Throughout my four-year academic journey—beginning with an associate’s degree in Computer Information Technology at Indiana Wesleyan University and culminating in a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University—I have completed a diverse array of projects, assignments, and research studies that have played a crucial role in shaping my technical strengths and clarifying my professional direction. These cumulative experiences have provided me with both the confidence and the practical, industry-relevant skills necessary for effective problem-solving in the IT and computer science fields.

My coursework has provided comprehensive exposure to key areas of computing, including programming, data structures and algorithms, artificial intelligence, web development, and database frameworks. Completing this ePortfolio, along with undertaking several self-directed enhancement projects, has allowed me to demonstrate my capability, adaptability, and determination to master new technologies and solve complex problems. These efforts reflect not only my technical competency but also my commitment to continuous learning. I view each new project or enhancement as an opportunity to further refine my expertise and expand my ability to contribute meaningfully within the software development and IT landscape.

Working in team-based environments throughout the program strengthened my collaboration skills, especially when using Git and GitHub to coordinate changes, review code, and maintain version control. I also gained experience communicating with stakeholders by writing design documents, explaining technical decisions, and translating complex concepts—such as reinforcement learning behavior or database schema design—into language that non-technical audiences could follow. These experiences helped me develop confidence in both teamwork and professional communication.

My technical coursework provided a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security. Building programs that used trees, hash maps, and sorting algorithms sharpened my ability to evaluate the efficiency and scalability of different solutions. Projects like my web-based inventory application and Grazioso Salvare dashboard taught me how to design modular software, build and query databases, and follow structured development processes. In addition, implementing secure coding practices—such as input validation, safe file handling, and proper authentication—helped me understand how to create systems that are both functional and secure.

Overall, the combination of coursework and ePortfolio development has prepared me to enter the computer science field with a strong professional identity. It allowed me to demonstrate not only my technical expertise, but also my values as a computer science professional: clarity, collaboration, security-minded design, and a commitment to continuous learning. These experiences have made me far more confident, prepared to build a rewarding career, and eager to establish a strong reputation as I pursue opportunities in the industry.

<b> Whats included:</b>

In this professional portfolio, I have included three original projects completed throughout my academic journey and reworked them into enhanced technical artifacts that demonstrate the full range of my abilities as a computer science professional. These enhancements showcase my strengths in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database development, while also reflecting my personal commitment to problem-solving and continuous improvement. Each artifact highlights a distinct core competency—ranging from system architecture and secure data handling to AI experimentation and full-stack development—and together they form a cohesive representation of my technical depth, adaptability, and overall growth. Collectively, these works illustrate my ability to design, implement, test, and refine software solutions across various domains, as well as the professional mindset and skills I bring to future opportunities in the computer science field.
